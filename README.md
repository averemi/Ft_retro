The entities of the game are each represented by a character on the terminal screen.

The basic characteristics are:

• Single-player

• Display using the ncurses library

• Horizontal or vertical scrolling (The screen area moves through the world, very much like in R-Type for example)

• Random enemies

• The player can shoot at enemies

• Basic collision handling (If an enemy touches you, you die)

• Game entities occupy multiple ’squares’ of the map

• Displaying score, time, number of lives, etc... on screen

• Clock-based timing

• Enemies can also shoot

• Scenery (Collidable objects or simple background)

• Enemies have a scripted behaviour

• Game sound
